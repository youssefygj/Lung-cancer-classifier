# Lung-cancer-classifier, Bachelor Project
Lung cancer, a leading cause of cancer-related mortality, necessitates innovative approaches for early detection and personalized treatment. The chance that a man will
develop lung cancer in his lifetime is about 1 in 16; for a woman, the risk is about 1 in
17, furthermore, there are still improvements for prioritizing lung cancer biomarkers.
This thesis leverages machine learning and bioinformatics to identify potential genetic
biomarkers for lung cancer, utilizing RNA sequencing data from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). A differential expression analysis of 598 samples (539 cancer samples and
59 control normal tissues) revealed 515 differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Gene set
enrichment analysis of these DEGs highlighted significant enrichment in pathways like
neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction and diseases like thrombophilia, suggesting their
different roles in lung cancer biology. Machine learning models, including Random Forest
and Support Vector Machines, were able to effectively predict cancer samples, achieving
94 percent accuracy for RF and 100 percent accuracy for SVM; furthermore, variable importance analysis, along with STRING Network database, pinpointed genes such as ALPP
(downregulated), Bex1 (downregulated), HSD17B6 (upregulated), and TCEAL2 (upregulated) as potential biomarkers that need further investigation. This study combines
machine learning with bioinformatics analysis to spot potential lung cancer biomarkers,
potentially paving the way for improved diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic strategies
